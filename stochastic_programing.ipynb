        "Summary:\n",
        "\n",
        "The farmer considers the possibility of correlation among the yields of different crops. To simplify, they assume that years can be categorized as good(up 20%), fair, or bad, resulting in above-average, average, or below-average (down 20%) yields for all crops. The impact of weather conditions and yields on prices is assumed to be insignificant.\n",
        "\n",
        "To assess the sensitivity of the optimal solution to yield variations, the farmer performs two additional optimizations based on above average and below average yields. The optimal solutions obtained in these cases are presented in Tables 3 and 4.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the case of above average yields, smaller land areas are needed to meet the minimum requirements in wheat, corn, and the sugar beet quota. The surplus land is allocated to wheat, and the extra production is sold. Conversely, in the case of below average yields, larger land areas are required to meet the minimum requirements and the sugar beet quota. However, corn requirements cannot be fully met through production alone, and some corn must be bought.\n",
        "\n",
        "The optimal solution is highly sensitive to yield changes. The allocated land areas for wheat range from 100 acres to 183.33 acres, for corn from 25 acres to 80 acres, and for sugar beets from 250 acres to 375 acres. Consequently, the overall profit ranges from $59,950 to $167,667.\n",
        "\n",
        "While long-term weather forecasts would be helpful, accurately predicting weather conditions six months in advance is challenging. Therefore, the farmer must make decisions without perfect information on yields.\n",
        "\n",
        "This summary provides an overview of the farmer's analysis regarding the sensitivity of the optimal solution to yield variations and the challenges associated with relying on weather predictions.\n",
